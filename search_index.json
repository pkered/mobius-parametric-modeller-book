Graphs contain nodes connected by links—which may be given a direction and visualised by an arrow—to form a flowchart. Such a system orders the information that is known at the beginning of the flowchart, and proceeds along the links to compute the unknowns or to solve a given constraint.\n     \n       \n     \n(1) Access Flowchart (2) Chain(Links) of Blocks(Nodes)\nNodes\nNodes are containers of code that carry procedures on how to process the information passing through it. \nThe number of nodes in each flowchart varies depending on the complexity of the modelling task. In general, the parametric design process is broken down into stages, with each stage being contained within a node.\nWhile in the 'Flowchart' tab, \n\nTo create a new node, double-click anywhere in the canvas. \nTo rename a node, click on a node once to select it; click on it again to edit the name; click outside the node to commit the changes.\nTo edit the contents of a node, double-click on the node, which switches automatically to the 'Procedure' tab to allow modification to the code.\nTo reorganise the placement of nodes in the flowchart for better visualisation, click and hold while dragging to arrange. Zoom in or out on the flowchart by scrolling with the mouse wheel; zoom extents by clicking on the icon at the top right of the flowchart.\nTo delete a node, click on a node once to select it, then hit 'del' to delete it.\n\nLinks\nLinks are connections between nodes, and in a propagation-based system, they are represented by arrows in the flowchart. For information to pass from one node to another, they have to be connected by a link in the corresponding direction. \nWhile in the 'Flowchart' tab,\n\nTo connect one node to another, click anywhere in the grey highlight of the first node and drag to the receiving node before releasing. As you drag, you should see a faint dash line to show where the link will be; before releasing, the highlight around the receiving node should appear as you mouse over the node. The arrow signifies the direction that information is being passed.\nTo disconnect nodes, click on the link once to select it, then hit 'del' to delete it. A disconnected node is greyed out and the procedures within it will not be executed.\n\n     \n       \n     \n(3) Create New/Save/Load Flowchart (4) Execute Flowchart\nCreate New/Save/Load Flowchart\nTo create, save or load a flowchart, click on the name of the flowchart to display a dropdown enumeration, then select the corresponding option.\nExecution\nExecution of the flowchart results in a 3D model being pushed through the flowchart, starting at the Start node, and ending at  the End node. Along the way, each node executes the procedure that it contains.

The data model has been specifically developed for the Möbius Modeller, in order to allow complex semantically enriched geospatial parametric models to be created.\nOverview\nThe GI model allows different types of entities to be defined. These entities are defined using a data structure consisting of three main layers: positions, objects, and collections. The Figure below shows a conceptual diagram of this hierarchy. \n     \n       \n     Figure: The layers of the GI data model.\nGeometry\nThe GI data model allows users to directly create three types of geometry: positions, objects, and collections. (Topology, described below, will be generated indirectly.) These three types of geometry define the three layers of the data structure. \nThe bottom layer of the GI data model is the positions layer. Positions are locations in 3D space, specified by three coordinates, [x,y,z]. Such positions are starting point for all other types of geometric entities. \nThe middle layer of the GI data model consists of objects. There are three  types of objects: points, polylines, and polygons. Points are simple points in space. Polyline consist of a sequence of straight line segments. Polylines can be closed or open, and can be planar or non-planar. Polygons are surfaces define by an exterior boundary consisting of a sequence of straight line segments. The polygon may also have hole, in which case it will include additional interior boundaries, also sequences of straight line segments. Polygons may be planar or non-planar. \nThe top layer of the GI data model consists of collections. Collections group together objects that are semantically related in some way.\n(For more information on user-defined geometry, see section 2.1.)\nTopology\nObjects are define using a hierarchy topological components, consist of four levels: vertices, edges, wires, and faces. A vertex is a location in space, linked to exactly one position. An edge connects two vertices with a straight line segment. A wire consists of a sequence of edges, connected through shared vertices. If a wire may be open or closed. Finally, a face defines a surface bounded by a closed wire. A face may also have additional wires defining the holes in the face. A point has exactly one vertex. A polyline has exactly one wire, which can have multiple edges and vertices. A polygon has exactly one face, which will have one or more wires, each of which can be further decomposed into multiple edges and vertices.\nThe key concept in the GI data model is that the topological components inside objects are never shared. Thus, one object cannot share vertices or edges with another object. Instead, each object has its own distinct set of topological components. However, this is not the case for positions and collections. \n\nFirst, objects can have vertices that link to the same positions. This allows objects to be connected together. We refer to this as the the vertices being 'welded'. When the positions are modified (i.e. moved), both objects will be updated.\nSecond, objects can belong to multiple collections. Thus, a polygon that represents a wall can belong to two 'room' collections, representing the two rooms on either side of the wall.\n\n(For more information on topological components, see section 2.2.)\nAttributes\nAll entities (positions, objects, topological components, and collections) in a GI data model can have data attached to them, in the form of attributes. This is a powerful feature that allows models to become semantically enriched with all sorts of data. \nAn attribute is associated with a specific entity type and has a name, a data type, and a data size. The possible data types are string or number. The data size can be 1 or more. If the data size is greater than 1, then the attribute will be assumed to be a list. Each entity can then have different values for that specified attribute.\n(For more information on attributes, see section 2.3.)\n Terminology\n The terminology for a GI model is as follows:\n\nEntity: Refers to any type of entity in the model, including positions, objects, topologies, and collections.\nGeometry: Refers to all entities except topologies, including positions, objects, and collections.\nCollection: A collection of objects. Object may appear in more than one collection. \nObject: A point, a polyline, or a polygon.\nTopology: A vertex, an edge, a wire, or a face. Also referred to as 'topological components'. \nPosition: A position, that can be linked to vertices. Each position can be linked to multiple vertices. \n\n"},"contents/chapter2/2.1.geometry.html":{"url":"contents/chapter2/2.1.geometry.html","title":"Geometry","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 1 h2 0 h3 0 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nGeometry\nUser-defined geometry is created by explicitly specifying a position or list of positions. \nPosition\nA position is an entity that is created at a location in space; while it is not an object, it is the primary unit by which all other geometries are defined. In order to make a point, polyline or polygon, a position(s) has to be created first, before being referenced subsequently. \nPoint\nA point is a zero-dimensional object defined at a location as specified by a single position. It is represented in the 3D viewer as a sphere of negligible dimensions.\nPolyline\nA polyline is an object defined by a list of at least two positions. The polyline is drawn sequentially based on the order of the positions within the list. \nPolygon\nA polygon is an object defined by a list of at least three positions, comprising a closed wire and a face. The polygon is drawn sequentially based on the order of the positions within the list. \nCollection\nA collection is a list containing any of the above objects; the objects in the list may be of differing types.\n"},"contents/chapter2/2.2.topology.html":{"url":"contents/chapter2/2.2.topology.html","title":"Topology","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 1 h2 1 h3 0 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nTopology\n     \n       \n     Figure: Overview\nTopology is automatically generated from existing user-defined objects. Attributes may be attached to topological components, which may be viewed in the Attribute Table. \nVertex\nA vertex is a location in space, and can be connected to zero, one, or two edges. \nEdge\nAn edge is a line segment joining two vertices in a polyline or polygon.\nWire\nA wire is a multi-segmented line defining a polyline or bounding the surface of a polygon. \nFace\nA face is a surface bounded by a wire(s).\nHierarchy\nAll objects can be broken down into their topological components, which are connected in a hierarchy. The figures below show two examples of the topological hierarchy, for a polyline and a polygon. The polygon also includes a hole. \n     \n       \n     Figure: Topological hierarchy for polyline\n     \n       \n     Figure: Topological hierarchy for polygon\nObjects sharing positions\nWhen multiple objects share the same positions, modifying one object could mean modifying the positions for it, which could affect all other objects that share those positions.\nWhen an object needs to be moved without affecting other objects, it needs to be unwelded. Unwelding creates a duplicate of the shared positions (by creating new positions at that same location). As a result, the positions for the different objects will be different, even though they are at the same location. \nThe following diagrams show the differences between welded and unwelded polylines and polygons:\n     \n       \n     Figure: Welded polylines\n     \n       \n     Figure: Unwelded polylines\n     \n       \n     Figure: Welded polygons\n     \n       \n     Figure: Unwelded polygons\n"},"contents/chapter2/2.3.attributes.html":{"url":"contents/chapter2/2.3.attributes.html","title":"Attributes","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 1 h2 2 h3 0 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nAttributes\nAttributes define the types of data that can be attached to entities. The attribute values may be viewed in the Attribute Table. \nDefault Attributes\nThere are default attributes that are generated when certain objects are created. Specifically, when positions are created, the coordinates of each position are automatically displayed as attributes in the Attribute Table. \nOne default attribute is the XYZ coordinates of positions. In this case, the attribute is associated with positions entities, the name is xyz, the data type is number and the data size is 3. Each position then has different XYZ values for this attribute. \nAll entities also have a default id attribute that specifies a unique ID for the entity. The IDs consists of a two letters followed by a number. The letters define the entity type, as follows:\n\nps: positions\n_v: vertices\n_e: edges\n_w: wires\n_f: faces\npt: points\npl: polylines\npg: polygons\nco: collections\n\nUser-defined Attributes\nTo assign an attribute, you will need either the id or the variable that refers to it. In order to obtain the id of the entities, so as to assign attributes to them, use the query.Get function.\nTo create an attribute, create a new variable (Basic > Variable). \n\nIn the left-hand side argument of the variable, enter id@attributename or variable@attributename to create an attribute named attributename for a particular id or variable (of geometries or mathematical structures) respectively. \n\nIn the right-hand side argument of the variable, enter the value of the attribute. The value may be a number, a string, or a flat list. \n\nExample 1: \"ps1\"@selected = \"yes\" creates a new attribute named \"selected\" for the id of ps1, and gives the position \"ps1\" the value of \"yes\". The id here refers to the id given to the geometry, and can be found in the first column of the attribute table. IDs must be placed between double quotation marks to differentiate them from being read as variables.\n\n\n\n     \n       \n     Figure: Example 2\n\nExample 2: point_a@rgb = [255,0,0] creates three attributes named \"rgb[0]\", \"rgb[1]\", and \"rgb[2]\", and sets their values at 255, 0, 0 respectively for the geometry given by a previously-defined variable named point_a.\n\nTo set an attribute, perform the same steps as if to create an attribute, but ensure that attributename is the name of the existing attribute whose value you wish to alter. Simply put, if the attribute has not been previously created, a new attribute is created; otherwise, it changes the value of that attribute.\n     \n       \n     Figure: Example 3\n\nExample 3: point_a@rgb = [10,20,30] changes the existing values of 255, 0, 0 to 10, 20, 30 respectively for \"rgb[0]\", \"rgb[1]\", and \"rgb[2]\" of point_a.\n\nTo get the value of an attribute, use id@attributename or variable@attributename inline to reference their values.\n     \n       \n     Figure: Example 4\n\nExample 4: my_number = point_a@rgb[1] gives my_number the value of 20, since point_a has the value of 20 set for the attribute of rgb[1].\n\n     \n       \n     Figure: Deleting\nTo delete an attribute, set the attribute with the value of null (without quotes).\nAdding attributes to multiple items\nCreating or adding an attribute to a list does so for all items in the list.\n     \n       \n     Figure: Example 4\n\nExample 5: my_list@yes_or_no = \"yes\" sets \"yes\" for the attribute named \"yes_or_no\" for ps1, ps2, and ps3.\n\n"},"contents/chapter3/3.1.overview.html":{"url":"contents/chapter3/3.1.overview.html","title":"Chapter 3: Öbi Language","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 2 h2 0 h3 0 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nChapter 3: Öbi Language\nThis chapter discusses the Öbi visual programming language. \nEach Öbi program is defined by a flowchart and a set of procedures.

Single quotation marks and double quotation marks are accepted; however, do not mix them.\nAccepted: \"hello\", 'hello'\nNot accepted: \"hello'\nParenthesis\nSquare brackets [ and ] are used to denote lists and indexing of lists.\nRound brackets ( and ) are used for inline functions and for mathematical and logical operations.\nComparison operators\n\n== equal (in value)\n=== equal (in value AND type)\n less than\n less than or equal to\n> more than\n>= more than or equal to\n!= not equal to\n\nLogical operators\n\n&& AND\n\n|| OR\n\n! NOT\n\nExample:\n\na == 5 && b != 10 would mean a equals to 5 AND b not equals to 10\na == 5 && b != 10 || c == 15 would mean (a equals to 5 AND b not equals to 10) OR c equals to 15\n\n\n\nPrecedence of logical operators\nYou can use round brackets to group operands with their logical operators, as you do in mathematics to denote hierarchy. However, in the absence of parenthesis, \n\n! takes higher precedence over &&\n&& takes higher precdence over ||\n\nSo a == 5 && b != 10 || c == 15 would be taken to be the same as (a == 5 && b != 10) || (c == 15). \nMathematical operators\n\n+ add \n- subtract\n* multiply\n/ divide\n% modulo (remainder after division)\n\n"},"contents/chapter3/3.6.list.html":{"url":"contents/chapter3/3.6.list.html","title":"List","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 2 h2 4 h3 0 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nList\nSquare brackets are used to denote lists, as well as to refer to the index of a list. \nNumbering in Möbius Modeller follows programming, where the index starts from 0 instead of one.

As the output are just positions, it may be less visible how 'flat'/'columns'/'rows'/'squares' are any different just yet. However, you may choose to print this function to see the way the data is composed. \nHere, we have chosen to use 'squares', so what is returned is a list of (sub-)lists of positions. The positions in each sub-list are the four vertices that will form the square, and all these sub-lists are put into one list. This is important, so that when we are creating polylines from this grid positions, the polylines are drawn based on the sub-lists, which determines the visualised pattern. \ngrid dimensions = number of squares  size of squares\ngrid dimensions in x-direction = `num_sq_x  sq_sizegrid dimensions in y-direction =num_sq_y * sq_size`\nWhen creating a grid of positions, there will always be one more position in each direction than the number of spaces—since spaces are between two points. \nIMAGE\nnumber of squares in x-direction = num_sq_x\nnumber of squares in y-direction = num_sq_y\nTo determine the number of positions in the grid, \nnumber of positions in x-direction = num_sq_x + 1\nnumber of positions in y-direction = num_sq_y + 1\nmake.Polyline\nFrom the positions returned by pattern.Grid, we are able to create polylines. Points, polylines, polygons and other geometry are defined by positions and are dependent on them. Therefore, whenever you wish to create geometry, you need to first create positions. \nHere, you may choose to add the line make.Point before you use make.Polyline. Points may be created to help visualise where the positions are in the 3D viewer and to check if the outcome is as intended. This step is not strictly necessary. \nmodify.Move\nWe now want to move the grid of positions such that the corner of the grid starts at XY (which is the world origin [0,0,0]). \nSince the grid has dimensions num_sq_x * sq_size by num_sq_y * sq_size with centre at the world origin, to shift it to the desired location, we will move it by half of its lengths:\nnum_sq_x * sq_size / 2 in the x-direction; and\nnum_sq_y * sq_size / 2 in the y-direction. \nThe reason for the need to move the grid will be to make all values of the x- and y-coordinates positive; further explanation will be provided later.\n"},"contents/chapter6/6.2.3.node2a.html":{"url":"contents/chapter6/6.2.3.node2a.html","title":"Node 2a","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 5 h2 0 h3 2 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nNode 2a\nIn this node, we want to move each rectangle upwards depending on its position in the grid. \n     \n       \n     \n(1) Move by x-coordinate (2) Move by y-coordinate (3) Move by x- and y-coordinate\nTo do so, we created the following procedure:\n     \n       \n     Figure: Procedure\nquery.Get\nBy now, you would have noticed that all the geometry that was created in the previous node is automatically transferred to this one. In order to make use of the polylines created in the previous node, we use the query function. This function is very powerful, as you can filter what is gotten by specifying attribute conditions. \nIn order to use the rectangular polylines that we created previously, we need to run a query to get their ids. \nFor-each loop\nA for-each loop is a quick way of performing repeated actions without having to do them one by one. Since we are creating a rectangle for each position, putting the steps to create a rectangle from a position in this loop allows us to repeat all the steps in the loop for every single position. \n\"For-each pl in pls\" simply means for each item in the list of items, since pls is defined as all the polylines previously created, so this translates as \"for each polyline in the list of polylines previously created\".\nmake.Unweld\nVisually, the vertices of each rectangle are common between adjacent rectangles. In the model, more specifically, the positions for each rectangle are shared. The implications of this is that when you move a polyline, you move the positions that define it. As a result, moving a rectangle in the middle of the grid will produce the following:\nIMAGE\nIn order to separate that rectangle out, make.Unweld creates new positions for each of the shared positions, so that they are no longer shared. Instead, there will be two sets of positions at the same location. \ncalc.Centroid\nIn order to move the rectangles based on their positions in the grid, we first need a method to determine where the rectangle is in the grid. calc.Centroid gives the xyz-coordinates of the centre of the rectangle, which can be then compared between rectangles.\nDisplacement\nThe modify.Move function moves the geometry by a vector (i.e. [x, y, z]). Since we are moving the rectangles upwards, the value of x and y will be kept as 0. \n\ncentre_xyz[0] returns the x-coordinate of the midpoint of the rectangle\ncentre_xyz[1] returns the y-coordinate of the midpoint of the rectangle. \n\nBy placing the move function in a for-each loop, the following steps are repeated:\n\nFind out how far away the rectangle is from the origin (in x- or y- or both directions)\nThe further away the rectangle it, the greater the displacement\n\nIMAGE\nIn this flowchart, we have multiplied the displacement by decrease_factor for better visualisation of the pattern; otherwise, the rectangles are too far apart for the pattern to be distinct. This factor acts to scale the displacement by one-fifth of the original. \nDisabling lines\nSome lines have been disabled in the procedure above. Disabling a line means that it will not be run when the flowchart is executed. There are two modify.Move functions with different distances; to toggle between them, disable one and enable another. \nReason for moving the grid\nIn Node 1, we moved the grid so that the x- and y- coordinates are always positive. This is not crucial or necessary, but it makes the numbers easier to manipulate as we do not have to deal with negative numbers (e.g. range will be 0 to 10 instead of -5 to 5).\n"},"contents/chapter6/6.2.4.node2b.html":{"url":"contents/chapter6/6.2.4.node2b.html","title":"Node 2b","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 5 h2 0 h3 3 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nNode 2b\nIn this node, we want to move each rectangle upwards depending on its position in the grid, in a way such that it the overall pattern resembles a sine or cosine wave. \n     \n       \n     \nTop: (1) sine wave based on x-coordinate (2) cosine wave based on x-coordinate\nBottom: (3) sine wave based on y-coordinate (4) cosine wave based on y-coordinate\nTo do so, we created the following procedure:\n     \n       \n     Figure: Procedure\nThe procedure, in terms of the functions used, is the same as Node 2a; the only difference is in the values inputted into the arguments. \nCreation of sine/cosine waves\nIf we wish to displace the rectangles into a wave based on its position, we will again calculate the centre of each rectangle as in Example 2.

This is helpful if you have already fixed certain parameters at desired values, and want the remaining transformations to be executed faster in the program (since it uses the geometry directly without computing it).

Instead of Foreach pl in pls, we use Foreach i in range(0,length(pls)). Let's break this down further.\nThe inline function of length(list) gives the length of a list. So length(pls) gives the length of the list, also known as the number of polylines in the list. \nThe inline function of range(min,max) creates a list of numbers from min to max. So range(0,length(pls)) creates a list of numbers starting from zero, and the number of numbers in this list is equal to the number of polylines. \nAs a result, pls[0] gives the first polyline, pls[1] gives the second polyline and so on, till pls[number of polylines -1] gives the last polyline. In order to refer to each of the polyline, we use pls[i], where i will be equal to 0, 1, 2, 3,...number of polylines-1. \nLogic\nHere we do not want to create extrusions for all the polylines, but rather only do so in a checkerboard pattern. Accordingly, we need to choose which polylines to extrude, and we can do so by creating a condition based on their index i. \ni = 0 for the first polyline;\ni = 1 for the second polyline;\ni = 2 for the third polyline;...\nIf we use i%2==0, the '%' sign is the modulo function, which roughly translates to \"the remainder after dividing\". So, If i%2==0 means \"if the remainder of i divided by 2 has a value equal to 0\". \nSetting this as the condition would return the values of i = 0, 2, 4, 6,... which are all even numbers. \n     \n       \n     Figure: i%2==0\nSetting the condition as If i%2==1 gives values of i = 1, 3, 5, 7,... which are all odd numbers. \n     \n       \n     Figure: i%2==1\nBy using If floor(i/10)%2==0, floor(i/10) would mean rounding down the result to the nearest integer for i/10. (For example, when i=12, i/10 = 1.2 and rounding that down by using the floor function would give 1.)\n\ni= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 would give floor(i/10)=0;\ni= 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 would give floor(i/10)=1;\ni= 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 would give floor(i/10)=2; and so on.\n\nSo If floor(i/10)%2==0 would return i = 0-9, 20-29, and so on. \n     \n       \n     Figure: floor(i/10) % 2 == 0\nIf we want to combine both alternating sequences for rows and columns, we need to use the operator '&&'. If A = true &&B = true means both A and B has to be true. If we only need either condition to be true, we will use If A = true || B = true, where '||' means or. \n     \n       \n     Figure: floor(i/10) % 2 == 0 && i%2 == 1\nCombining both the and and the or conditions, we get:\nfloor ( i / 10 ) % 2 == 0&&i % 2 == 1||floor ( i / 10 ) % 2 == 1&&i % 2 == 0\nwhich in simple language means:\nif \"remainder of (i divided by 10) divided by 2 is 0 AND remainder of i divided by 2 is 1\" OR if \"remainder of (i divided by 10) divided by 2 is 1 AND remainder of i divided by 2 is 0\"\nThis condition gives the final result of the checkerboard pattern. \n     \n       \n     Figure: Final condition\n"},"contents/chapter6/6.4.4.node2.html":{"url":"contents/chapter6/6.4.4.node2.html","title":"Node 2","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: chapter 2 h1 5 h2 2 h3 3 h4 0 h5 0 h6 0;\n}\n\nNode 2\nIn this node, we want to rotate the model from lying on the horizontal plane to a vertical plane, such that it would resemble a wall with extrusions and apertures.\n     \n       \n     Figure: Result\nTo do so, we created the following procedure:\n     \n       \n     Figure: Procedure\nFirst, we get the polylines and polygons in the model (i.e. all the geometry in the model, since these are the only two that we have created so far) using the query.Get function.
